/*Attached is a template of a high school transcript.
Your goal is to create a program that replicates the output. 
You may modify the layout, but all the types of information displayed should be present. 
Initially output to the Console is OK, but the final should actually create an external document!
You will host this project on github, a popular version control system.
You MUST plan your design before you start implementing your ideas. 
Keep it light-weight for now, simply what classes you will have, what properties(variables) and behaviors(functions/methods).
This will be your starting point for the project, upload it here before you start coding! This should be updated to reflect changes in your design as your project progresses.
